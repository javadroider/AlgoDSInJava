Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern adds an interface to existing system to hide its complexities.

**Real life example**

Event Manager. Whenever there is some function,we will approach event managers with list of requirements like food we need,kind of stage we need,kind of invitaion cards we need,kind of music we need. Now event manager handles everything by himself without letting us know whats happening in the background. 
It also provides transaction boundary.

**Project Example**

Account archival process. So many steps are involved which are hidden.

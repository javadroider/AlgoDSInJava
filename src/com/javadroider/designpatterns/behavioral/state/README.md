- It is used when an object change it’s behavior based on it’s internal state.
- If we have to change the behavior of an object based on it’s state, we can have a state variable in the object and use if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the state. 
- State pattern is used to provide a systematic and lose-coupled way to achieve this through Context and State implementations.

#### State Design Pattern Benefits

- The benefits of using State pattern to implement polymorphic behavior is clearly visible. 
- The chances of error are less and it’s very easy to add more states for additional behavior. 
- Thus making our code more robust, easily maintainable and flexible. 
- Also State pattern helped in avoiding if-else or switch-case conditional logic in this scenario.

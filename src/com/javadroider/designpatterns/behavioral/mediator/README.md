Mediator pattern, used to handle complex communications between related objects, helping with decoupling of those objects.

Mediator design pattern is used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system. Mediator design pattern is very helpful in an enterprise application where multiple objects are interacting with each other. If the objects interact with each other directly, the system components are tightly-coupled with each other that makes maintainability cost higher and not flexible to extend easily. Mediator pattern focuses on provide a mediator between objects for communication and help in implementing lose-coupling between objects.


An airport control tower is an excellent example of the mediator pattern. The tower looks after who can take off and land - all communications are done from the airplane to control tower, rather than having plane-to-plane communication. This idea of a central controller is one of the key aspects to the mediator pattern.

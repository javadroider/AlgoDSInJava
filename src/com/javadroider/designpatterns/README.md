# Java Design Patterns

Design Patterns are very popular among software developers. A design pattern is a well-described solution to common software problem.

Some of benefits of using design patterns are :
  * Design patterns are already defined and provides industry standard approach to solve recurring problem,
    so it saves time if we  use  the design pattern .
  * Using design pattern promotes re-usability that leads to more robust and highly maintainable code.
  * Since design patterns are already defined, it makes out code easy to understand and debug. It lead to faster development and new members of team understand it easily.

__Java Design Patterns__ are divided into three parts : *Creational*, *Structural* and *Behavioral*.

## [CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/creational)

  Creational design pattens provide solution to instantiate an object in the best possible way for specific situations.
  The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or add unwanted complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by __controlling the object creation__ by different ways.
  There are five creational design patterns that we will discuss on :

1. [Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/creational/singleton)
2. [Factory Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/creational/factory)
3. [Abstract Factory Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/creational/abstractfactory)
4. [Builder Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/creational/builder)
5. [Prototype Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/creational/prototype)

## [STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/structural)

  Structural patterns provide different ways to create a class structure, for example using inheritance and composition to create a large object from small objects.
1. [Proxy Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/structural/proxy)
2. [Facade Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/structural/facade)
3. [Adapter Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/structural/adapter)
4. [Flyweight Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/structural/flyweight)
5. [Decorator Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/structural/decorator)
6. [Composite Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/structural/composite)

## [BEHAVIORAL DESIGN PATTERNS](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/behavioral)

Behavioral patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects and how to provide lose coupling and flexibility to extend easily.
1. [Template Method Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/behavioral/template)
2. [Mediator Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/behavioral/mediator)
3. [Chain of Responsibility Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/behavioral/cor)
4. [Observer Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/behavioral/observer)
5. [Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/behavioral/strategy)
6. [Command Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/behavioral/command)
7. [State Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/behavioral/state)
8. [Visitor Pattern](https://github.com/javadroider/AlgoDSInJava/tree/master/src/com/javadroider/designpatterns/behavioral/visitor)
9. [Iterator Pattern](https://www.oodesign.com/iterator-pattern.html)

- Flyweight design pattern is used when we need to create a lot of Objects of a class. 
- Since every object consumes memory space that can be crucial for low memory devices, such as mobile devices or embedded systems, flyweight design pattern can be applied to reduce the load on memory by sharing objects. 
- String Pool implementation in java is one of the best example of Flyweight pattern implementation

Project Example :
- 
- Offline reports - Each cell is taken from pool instead of creating new one.

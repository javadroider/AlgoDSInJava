# Algorithms and Datastructures in Java
This is my repository of alogorithms & datastructures. Everytime I plan to refersh my algo & DS knowlegde or plan to give interviews I go over internet to look for intersting questions & solutions.

I thought I should put my findings in some place so that others also can make use of it.
